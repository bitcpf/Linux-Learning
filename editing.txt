 have coined a phrase for myself - 'CUT to the G':

     1. Concentrate

3. Think 4. Get Things Done

     Step stpe 4 is eventually gets what you moving, but Steps 2 and 3 are
     equally important. As Abraham Lincoln once said "If I had eight
     hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend six hours sharpening my
     axe." And to get to this stage, you need to do Step 1 which boils
     down to one thing - It's all in the mind. That's why it's so
     hard.

     1. Concentrate
     2. Understand
                               3. Think
     4. Get Things Done
